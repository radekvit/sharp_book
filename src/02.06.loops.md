# Loops
Sharp has several loop statements. This section showcases all of them.

## Loop
Loop cycles until another mechanism breaks the loop.
The possible loop breaking statements are:
- `return` - exits the whole function
- `break` - breaks the loop execution
- `continue` - skips the rest of the code in the block and continues with the next iteration

```
var x = 100
loop
	--x
	if x == 0
		break;
```

## While
While loops execute until their conditions are false
```
var x = 5
// regular while
while x < 42
	x++

// do-while
do
	--x
while x > 5
```

## For
For loops are much like *foreach* loops in other languages; they only work with iterable objects.
The loop is executed for each member of the target using iterators.

The following example will write all numbers from 5 to 42.
```
for x in range(5u8, 42)
	print(x)
	print('\n')
```
