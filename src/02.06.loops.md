# Loops
Sharp has several loop statements. This section showcases all of them.

## Loop
Loop cycles until another mechanism breaks the loop.
The possible loop breaking statements are:
- `return` - returns from a function
- `break` - breaks the loop execution
- `continue` - skips the rest of the code in the block and continues with the next iteration
- `throw` - throwing an exception, discussed in TODO

```
var x: mut = 100
loop
	--x
	if x == 0
		break
```

Break and continue can be followed by an integer literal to break out of multiple cycles at once:
```
loop
	loop
		break 2
// continues here
```

## While and Until
While loops execute until their condition is false. Until loops execute until their condition is true. Both variants come in do-while variants with a postcondition.
```
var x: mut = 5_i64
// regular while
while x < 42
	x++
	
until x == 0
	--x

// do-while
do
	++x
while x < 5

do
	x--
until x == -1

```

## For
For loops are much like *foreach* loops in other languages; they only work with iterable objects.
The loop is executed for each member of the target using iterators.

The following example will write all numbers from 5 to 42.
```
import utils
use std::range

for x in range(5_u8, 43 - 5)
	print(x)
	print('\n')
```

The `for` loop as it appears in C is not present in Sharp; it can easily be achieved with a while loop.
