# Operator overloading
Almost all operators can be overloaded by a custom function.

Operators cannot be overloaded when:
- It is the `::`, `::<`, `and`, `xor`, or `or` operator
- An operator has already been defined for these types

Operator overloading has the following syntax:
```
class Foo

fn operator +(x: & Foo, y: & Foo): u8
	return 5
```

## Custom literals
Any type can be made first-class in Sharp by creating custom literals.
```
class Foo
public
	fn Foo(x: char)
		pass

fn operator ""_foo(x: char): Foo
	return Foo(x)
```

A custom literal can be defined for the following types:
- `char`
- `string`
- `f64`
- `u64`

A custom literal's identifier must satisfy the following:
- Starts with an underscore
- Is a sequence of alphanumeric characters and undersores

Custom literal functions are inlined by default.
