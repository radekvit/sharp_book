# Memory management
So far, we have created all our objects on the stack. Sharp provides exactly one mechanism for allocating objects on the heap.

```
var onHeap = box 5u8 // onHeap: Box<u8>
```

Operator `box` creates an object on the heap. It is not a pointer, however. The created object is very much like C++11's `std::unique_ptr`.

The `Box` object owns the heap-allocated object. A reference to the contained object can be obtained via the unary `*` uperator:
```
var x = box 5
var y: & = *x

var mut x = box 5
var y: mut & = *x
```

The heap object is automatically freed when the Box object goes out of scope.
