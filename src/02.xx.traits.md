# Traits
Traits define public interfaces; they require the classes and types that implement them to have the same interface. They may require methods, attributes and properties to be present.

Attribute interface requirements can be implemented by properties and vice versa; a trait treats all attributes as properties with the appropriate setters and getters.

## Inheritance interface
A class may inherit a trait. This means that that class can be put in a reference to that trait and implements its public interface.

```
trait Foo
	fn mut foo()
	fn foo()

	var x: bool

	property y: bool // is the same as 'var mut y: bool'
		get mut
		set

	property z: bool // only achievable by a property, getter not required
		set

class Bar: public Base, public Foo
public
	var z: bool
	var mut y: bool
	var x: bool

var b = Bar()
var x: mut & Foo = b // OK
```
## Generics interface
Traits can be used as an interface definition for generics. Any type can be passed as a generics argument even if it doesn't inherit this trait.

```
trait CanAdd
	fn static operator +(lhs: & CanAdd, rhs: & CanAdd): CanAdd

fn add<T: CanAdd> (lhs: & CanAdd, rhs: & CanAdd)
	return lhs + rhs

add(4, 5) // OK
```
