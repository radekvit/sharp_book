# Comments
We often want to include some information in the source code. Comments are the way to do this.
There are three different types of comments in Sharp.

## Line comments
A line comment starts with a double forward slash `//` and ends with the first newline.
We can put line comments wherever we want to convey additional information.
```
// a line comment
var x = 5 // another line comment
```

## Block comments
Block comments are different than line comments. They start with `/*` and end with `*/` and can span multiple lines.
Block comments are empty statements, much like `pass`.
They have to obey the physical line rules, discussed in TODO.

```
fn main()
	/* multiline comments
	have rules they have to obey
	*/
	var x = 5 /* this would cause an error
	*/
```

## Documentation comments
To document our code, we use documentation comments. They are similar to block comments, but differ in their beggining: `/**`.

They typically carry information about classes, functions and variables. A style very similar to Doxygen is used.
```
/**
\brief Does nothing.
\param [in] x A boolean that does not matter.
*/
fn foo (x: bool)
	pass
```
