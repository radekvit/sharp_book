# References
References *refer* to other variables. They can be used to avoid copying values.

References can be mutable or immutable. Their type annotation is either
`var x: & bool` for an immutable reference or `var x: mut & bool` for a mutable reference.
As discussed earlier, we read annotated types left-to-right, so `var x: & mut bool` means that `x` is an immutable reference to a mutable bool.
```
var x: mut u64 = 5

fn foo(x: & mut u64) // x is an immutable mutable reference to a mutable u64
	x = 42

foo(x)
// x == 42
```

We can change what mutable references refer to by rebinding them.
To rebind a reference, we can use the unary `&` operator:
```
var x = 5
var xx: mut = 55
var y: mut & = x // automatic inference of the referenced type
// y == 5
&y = xx // y now references xx
// y == 55
```
