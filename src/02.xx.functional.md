# Functional features
There are built-in types that have not been mentioned yet: functions.
Lambda functions, closures, objects and methods can all be stored in a function pointer.

```
var mut x: function<(_:bool, _:bool): bool> = [](a:bool, _:bool)
	return not a
x = [&](_, b) // inference from target type
	return b
var y = Foo()
x = y // operator () in class Foo
x = bind(Foo::bar, y, placeholders::_1) // method bar()
```

## Lambdas
Lambdas are anonymous functions.

```
var x = []()
	pass
```

## Closures
Closures have knowledge about the context of their creation. They can be created with either references to their context, or with copies of their context. Only the variables within the body will actually be stored.

```
var x = true
var mut y = false

var mut f = [&]()
	y = true // only mut reference to y will be stored
	return true

f = [=]()
	return x and y // both x and y stored by value

```
