# Syntax and Semantics
This chapter will introduce us to Sharp's syntax and semantics. Some prior knowledge is neccesary to understand this chapter, as explaining all concepts from scratch is way beyond the scope of this book.

The individual aspects are presented from the simplest concepts up to the most compex, so reading through it in order is a good way of learning Sharp.
Each section forms a reference to the individual aspects of Sharp and provides a short example showcasing the concepts.
