# Generics
Sharp supports generics. Generics allow for a definition of a function, object, trait, ... that work with an arbitrary type. They are parametrized with a type name. When a generic is instantiated, the type parameter is put in place of the generic type.

```
fn foo<T> (_: u8, _: T)
	pass

foo::<bool>(5, true)
```

## Inference of Generics Parameters
When there is no ambiguity, you don't have to explicitly pass the type parameter. This is true for functions, constructors, and member functions.

```
class Foo<T>
	var mut x_: T
public
	fn Foo(x: & T)
		x_(x)
	fn static bar<Y> (_: Y)
		pass

fn main()
	var mut x = Foo(true)
	// x is "mut x: Foo<bool>"
	Foo::bar(false) // Foo::bar<bool> is called
```
