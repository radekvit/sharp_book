# Enums
Enums are basically tagged unions in Sharp.

## Simple enums
In their simplest form, they are as follows:
```
enum Simple
	S_1
	S_2
```
The values `S_1` and `S_2` cannot be converted to any built-in type and serve only as enum members.
There is an automatic built-in function to convert them to strings (this is true for all variants of enums).

```
std::print(Simple::S_1 as String)
```

## Typed enums
We can define an enum like this:
```
enum Typed: UInt
	VALUE_1 = 0
	VALUE_2 // implitit 1
	VALUE_3 = 42
	VALUE_4 //implicit 43
	//OTHER_TYPE = true // error, forbidden
```

This enum can be converted to a UInt value.
```
var mut x = Typed::VALUE_1 // OK
var y: UInt = x // OK
//var x: Typed = 1 // ERROR, cannot assign UInt to enum Typed
```

## Individually typed enums
This is the most powerful enums can get in Sharp.
Each item in an enum can have its own type and carries any value of that type. The resulting enum is as big as the largest possible variant (similar to `union` in C, but more powerful). The items can be of any type.

```
// we have class MyClass

enum MixedType
	NOTYPE
	BOOL: Bool
	INT: UInt
	REFERENCE: mut & Bool
	CLASS: MyClass
	TUPLE: (MyClass, Bool)
	STRUCT: struct // anonymous struct
		var x: bool
		var mut y: u8
```

You can construct this enum in one of the following ways:
```
var mut x = MixedType::NOTYPE
x = MixedType::INT(5)
x = MixedType::CLASS(MyClass())
x = MixedType::TUPLE(MyClass(), false)
x = MixedType::STRUCT(y = 6, x = true)
```

The values can be deconstructed using the `switch` construct; all mutable values are given through a mutable reference, all immutables are given through a reference:
```
var x: MixedType
// x is filled here
switch x
	case NOTYPE
		pass
		// no value
	case BOOL(y)
		pass
		// y holds the Bool value
	case INT(y)
		pass
		// y holds the UInt value
	case REFERENCE(y)
		pass
		// y holds the reference
	case CLASS(y)
		pass
		// y holds a reference to the class; would be mutable if the class was mutable
	case TUPLE(x, y)
		pass
		// deconstructed the tuple
	case STRUCT(myX=x, myY=y)
		pass
		// myX holds a reference to x, myY holds a reference to y
```
