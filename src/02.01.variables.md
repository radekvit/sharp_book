# Variables
Variables are created when the keyword `var` is used, like this:
```
fn main(): usize
	var x = 5
```
As putting `fn main` in each example would get old very fast, we will ommit it from all following examples.

## Mutability
A variable without additional modifiers is *immutable*. This means that its value cannot be changed.
The keyword `mut` lets us create mutable variables, like this:
```
var x = 5
var mut y = 6
// x = 5 // error
y = 10 // OK
```

## Type annotations
Sharp is a statically typed language, which means that every variable only has one type during its lifetime.
When we don't specify a variable's type, it is automatically infered from the value we assign to it.
To specify the type of the variable we want to create, we declare it like this:
```
var x: u8 = 5
```
In this case, the variable `x` is an immutable 8-bit unsigned integer.

## Variable binding
If we want to create a variable and assign a value to it later, we have to annotate its type.
```
var x: bool
x = true
```
Before its first use, the variable has to be initialized; if it is not, the compiler will recognise this and the compilation will end with an error.

## Scope and shadowing
Variables have scope; they only live within the block they were defined in.
```
var mut x = 5
	var mut y = 6
	y = x // ok, y is now 5
	var x = 7
	y = x // y is now 7
x = y // error, y is no longer recognised as a variable
```

Within a single block, variables can be shadowed by another with the same name.
```
var x = 5
var x = false // variable x with value 5 is no longer visible
var y = x
```

When creating a new variable within a nested block, the behavior is the same:
```
var x = 5
	var x = false // previous x is no longer visible
	var y = x
```
