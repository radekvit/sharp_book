# Getting started
This first chapter of the book will guide us through installing Sharp and writing our first program.

## Hello, World!
Let's write a simple "Hello, world!" program in Sharp.

Let's create a file hello_world.sp and write the following program:
```
import io

use std::print

fn main()
	print("Hello, world!\n")
```
Note that each line of the body of the function `main` is indented by a single space character.

Now, we can compile it with sharpc: `$ sharpc hello_world.sp`
Running the program (`$ ./hello_world`) will now write out `Hello, world!`.
