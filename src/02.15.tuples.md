# Tuples
Tuples are one of the built-in types.
This section will discuss tuples in more detail.

We denote tuples with parentheses (`(5, 6)`); however, to be able to change the priority of operations within expressions, to create a 1-member tuple, we have to add a trailing comma (`(5, )`).

A tuple's type can be annotated as a generic type by `(bool, u8)`.

## Unpacking
We can unpack tuples by defining multiple variables at once:
```
var (x: Byte, y) = (5, "hello")
```
Simirarly, we can unpack tuples within expressions:
```
var x: mut Bool = false
var y: mut Bool = false
(x, y) = (true, false)
```

## Operations
There are two major variants of operations on tuples: tuple x tuple operations and tuple x single operations.

### Tuple x Tuple
Binary operations on tuples are only possible when they have the same number of members and when the operations are implemented on the corresponding types.
```
var t1 = (5, 6)
var t2 = (9, 7)
var t3 = (9,)

t1 + t2 // OK
//t1 + t3 // ERROR
```

The result of these kinds of operations is a tuple of the result types.
For example, the result of `(5, -5) * (0, 2)` will be `(0, -10)`.

### Tuple x Single
Operations between tuples and single values or unary operations on tuples are permitted in Sharp; their result will be the tuple of results.

For example, the result of `(4, 5) * 2` will be `(8, 10)`. The unary member of the operation is computed exactly once. The same applies for unary operators such as `++`, `&` or function calls. `([1,], [1, 2]).size()` returns `(1, 2)`.
