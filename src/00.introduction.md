# The Sharp programming language
This book will teach you about the Sharp programming language.
Sharp is a compiled, statically typed language with features from imperative, functional and object oriented languages.
It aims to be a fully featured, yet simple language that is easy to **write**, **read** and **maintain**.

## Goals
- **easy to write**
  Sharp generally has one simple way of expressing a concept. There are sufficient tools to achieve any desired behavior.
	Type inference saves typing and all language constructs should be familiar to any programmer familiar with C-style languages.

- **easy to read**
  Sharp enforces indentation and identifier conventions. It encourages programming against interfaces instead of types.
	TODO

- **easy to maintain**
  Programming against interfaces, TODO.
	Sharp utilizes namespaces to separate various TODO
