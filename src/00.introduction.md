# The Sharp programming language
This book will teach you about the Sharp programming language.
Sharp is a programming language with a healthy mixture of procedural, functional and object-oriented features.
It is made to make programming faster and easier while making the programmer use safe abstractions.

Sharp is compiled to LLVM, and thus provides better performance than dynamic languages while having a simple syntax that makes programming in Sharp as fast as in these quick scripting languages.
