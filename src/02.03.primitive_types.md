# Primitive types
Sharp has a number of built-in types. This section describes them.
The standard library provides you with a number of built-in types, but this section only describes the simplest of them.

## Booleans
`bool` can have either of two values: `true` or `false`.
```
var x = true
var y: bool = false
```

## Integers
There are two major types of integers in Sharp: signed and unsigned.
Signed integers can hold positive and negative values, like `5` or `-1`.
Unsigned integers can only hold values from `0` up.

Each integer type has two parts: its signedness and its size, for example `i16` is a 16-bit signed integer and `u64` is a 64-bit unsigned integer.
The available sizes are `8`, `16`, `32` and `64`.

There are another integer types, and those are `isize` and `usize`.
They have the size of the host architecture's pointer, typically 32 bits for 32-bit systems and 64 bits for 64-bit ones. They are the canonical return value of `main` (it always returns 0 if left unspecified).

## Floating point types
Sharp provides the typical floating point types with the signatures
`f16`, `f32` and `f64`. These correspond to IEEE-754 binary-16, single and double precision numbers.

## Characters
The `char` type is a single utf-8 character. Unlike most other languages, it is actually four bytes.
```
var x = 'c'
var x = 'âš›' // atom symbol
```

## Arrays
Sharp has arrays, like most other languages.
```
var x = {1, 3, 2} // x: u64 [3]
var y: u8 [50] = {0, 42,} // the rest are zeroes
```
Arrays have a fixed size and contain values of the same type.

```
var array = {1, 2, 3}
array.length() // array, length: 3
array[0] // access to the first element
array.first // or like this
array[array.length() - 1] // access to the last element
array.last // or like this
```
## Tuples
Tuples are a fixed-size sequence of potentially different types.
```
var tuple = (true, 5, 'c') // tuple: (bool, u64, char)
tuple.1 // second element
```

We will talk more about tuples and the operations with them in a later section.

## Strings
Strings are a built-in type.
They are dynamically sized sequences of utf-8 characters.

## Functions
Functions can be assigned into variables, like this:
```
fn foo()
	pass

var x = foo
```

We will talk about functional features more deeply in the following sections.
