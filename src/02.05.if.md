# If
If statements are very similar to other programming languages.

If the expression following `if` converted to `bool` is true, the block of code following is executed, otherwise the optional `else` branch is executed.
The blocks of code denoting the branches are indented by a single extra `tab` charecter. All code blocks are indented this way, removing the need for any parentheses to define blocks of code.

```
var mut x = 5

if x == 5
	x = 6
else if x == 6 // chaining ifs
	x = 5
else
	x = 0
```

If we changed `x` to something else, one of the other branches would execute.
