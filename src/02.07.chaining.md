# Chaining control statements
We can chain control statements.

For example if we want to iterate over odd numbers only, we can write
```
for x in range(16u64, 100) if x % 2
	print(x)
	print('\n')

// is the same as
for x in range(16u64, 100)
	if x % 2
		print(x)
		print('\n')
```

Note that in this manner, you can only define `else` branches if the `if` statement is the very first in the chain
and that you cannot chain `if` statements this way.
