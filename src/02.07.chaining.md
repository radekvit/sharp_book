# Chaining control statements
We can chain control statements. This allows us to save lines if several compound statements directly rely on each other.

For example if we want to iterate over odd numbers only, we can write
```
for x in range(16_u64, 100) if x % 2
	print(x)
	print('\n')

// is the same as
for x in range(16_u64, 100)
	if x % 2
		print(x)
		print('\n')
```

Note that in this manner, you can only define `else` branches if the `if` statement is the very first in the chain
and that you cannot chain `if` statements this way.
`do-while` and `do-until` loops, cannot be chained with any of the other compound statements.
