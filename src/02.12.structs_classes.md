# Structs
Structs are simple tools for keeping structured data. They are similar to tuples, but there are several key differences. Unlike tuples, no operations other than member access and assignment are implicitly defined for structs. Second, the members of structs are named.

In structs, you may declare struct attributes and declare other types. Struct methods are forbidden.

```
struct MyStructure
	use B = Bool

	var x: B
	var mut y: & B = x // implicit value
```
Structs can be constructed in one of the following ways:
```
var b = true
var x = MyStructure {y=b, x=true} // arbitrary order

var y = x // assignment
```

Their members can be accesed like attributes:
```
var y = x.x
var z: & = x.y
```

# Classes
Classes represent structures with operations on the data.
Sharp is in no way a pure object-oriented language, so classes serve the following:
- Composition
- Abstraction
- Simple code reuse
- Encapsulation

Polymorphism is not needed as traits substitute this behavior.

## Access modifiers
There are two access levels: `private`, and `public`.

`public` fields can be accessed by anyone.

`private` fields can only be accessed from this class or its subclasses.

All public class members must be defined before any private members.

```
class Foo
public
	var _x: Bool = False
private
	var _y: Bool = True
	var _z: Bool = False
```

## Attributes, Methods, and Properties
A class can have the following members: attributes, methods and properties.

```
class Foo
public
	fn Foo()
		// initializers in order of declaration
	  _x = False
		// other statements
	fn bar() // method
		return _x


	property y: & mut Bool // mutable property, auto backing field _y
		return _y
	property x: Bool // read-only property
		return _x
private
	var _x: Bool // attribute
	var _y: mut Bool = true // mutable attribute
```

## Attributes
Attributes are variables stored in classes.

### Static attributes
Static attributes are shared across all objects of that type.

```
class Foo
public
	var static x: mut Bool = true
```

## Methods
Methods are essentially functions with access to class variables.
There are three important things to know about methods:
- Mutability: Methods are immutable by default; they cannot modify class variables. To make a method able to change mutable class variables, it must be declared as `fn mut foo()`.
- Implicit return value: Where functions implicitly return an empty tuple, methods implicitly return a reference to their object (unless they are static; mutability is decided by the mutability of the called method).

```
class Foo
public
	fn foo()
		pass
	fn mut bar()
		_x = not this._x // in this case, _x is the same as this._x
private
	var mut _x: Bool
```

### Static methods
Static methods do not have access to object variables. They are essentially functions in the class's namespace.

```
class Foo
public
	fn static foo()
		// can access private static variables
		++ Foo::x
		return Foo::x
private
	var static x: mut = 0
```

### Constructors
TODO
The following implicit constructors are created unless explicitly deleted:
The implicit constructor (with no arguments) is implicitly declared unless an attribute exists with neither a default value assidned nor an implicit constructor to call.
The copy constructor, move constructor.

Constructors of parent classes and attributes may be called in the constructor body. The following restrictions apply:
- The constructors, if called, must be called in the correct order: The parent constructor(s), then members in order of declaration.

### Destructors
TODO
Destructors are implicitly generated, but can be defined by hand.
Destructors are automatically virtual if the class has any virtual functions.

Destuctors of members are automatically called. They are always called from the last declared to the first.

## Properties
Properties look like attributes, but actually run methods.
TODO

## Inheritance
A class can inherit from a single other class and can implement any number of traits.
There is no late binding (and thus no OO polymorphism), but methods of the last child class are called if a parent class has a method
that hasn't been redefined an calls methods that have been redefined.

```
class Parent
public
	fn foo()
		return bar()
	fn bar()
		return true

class Child
derives Parent
public
  fn bar() override
		return false

var x = Child
x.foo() // == false
```

Traits will be discussed in the following section.

## Friends
Within a class, you can define other classes with access to private fields.
Friend functions differ from static methods by being outside the class's namespace.

```
class Bar
private
	var static x = true

class Foo
public
	friend class Bar
	fn foo()
		return Bar::x
```
