# Structs
Structs are simple tools for keeping structured data. It is a very simple construct for which you cannot define any custom operators as it serves only as a storage construct.

```
struct MyStructure
	var x: bool
	var y: bool & = x // implicit value
```
Structs can be constructed in one of the following ways:
```
var b = true
var x = MyStructure(true, b) // in order
var x = MyStructure(y = b, x = true) // arbitrary order
```

Their members can be accesed like attributes:
```
var y = x.x
var z = x.y
```

# Classes
Classes represent structures with operations on the data.

## Access modifiers
There are three access levels: `private`, `protected`, and `public`.

`private` fields can only be accessed from this class.

`protected` fields can only be accessed from this class or its subclasses.

`public` fields can be accessed by anyone.

By default, class members are private.

```
class Foo
	var x: bool // default private
protected
	var y: bool
public
	var z: bool
```

## Attributes, Methods, and Properties
A class can have the following members: attributes, methods and properties.

```
class Foo
public
	fn bar() // method
		pass

	var x: bool // attribute

	property y: bool // write-only property, auto backing field
		set = default
		protected get = default
```

## Attributes
Attributes are variables in classes.

### Static attributes
Static attributes are shared across all objects of that type.

```
class Foo
public
	var static mut x: bool = true
```

## Methods
Methods are essentially functions with access to class variables.
There are three important things to know about methods:
- Mutability: Methods are immutable by default; they cannot modify class variables. To make a method able to change mutable class variables, it must be declared as `fn mut foo()`.
- Virtual: Methods are static by default. To make use of polymorphism, you must use the `virtual` keyword: `fn virtual foo()`. When overriding a method, you must use the `override` keyword instead.
- Implicit return value: Where functions implicitly return an empty tuple, methods implicitly return a reference to their object (unless they are static; mutability is decided by the mutability of the called object).

```
class Foo
protected
	var mut x: bool
public
	fn virtual foo()
		pass
	fn mut bar()
		x = not x
```

### Static methods
Static methods do not have access to class variables. They are essentially functions in the class's namespace.

```
class Foo
public
	fn static foo()
		return true
```

### Constructors
TODO
The following implicit constructors are created unless explicitly deleted:

### Destructors
TODO
Destructors are implicitly generated, but can be defined by hand.
Destructors are automatically virtual if the class has any virtual functions.

## Properties
Properties look like attributes, but actually run methods.

Each property may have the following:
- `set` - a mut method called when a value is assigned to the property. Has the implicit argument `value`. Always returns an empty tuple.
- `get` - The getter method. Returns the type of the property or a reference to it.
- `mut get` - A mut version of the getter method. If it is missing, the const version is always used. May return a mutable reference.

Either of the methods may have a stricter access level than the property itself. E.g. a public property may have a protected getter and not have the mutable getter at all.

```
class Foo
	property x: Foo
		protected mut get: mut & Foo
			// within setter and getter methods, x refers to the backing field, not to the property
			return x
		get // returns Foo
			return x
		set = default // default implementation
```

## Inheritance
A class can inherit from a single other class and can implement any number of traits.
Traits will be discussed in the following section.

## Friends
Within a class, you can define other classes with access to private fields.
Friend functions differ from static methods by being outside the class's namespace.

```
class Foo
private
	var static x: bool
public
	friend class Bar
	public
		fn foo()
			return Foo::x 
```

This is a complete example with most of the concepts explained:
```
class Foo
protected
	var mut x: bool
	fn mut virtual foo(bool y): bool
		var ret = x
		x = y
		return y
public
	property virtual z: bool
		set
			z = value
		mut get
			return foo(z)
		get
			return z

class Bar: public Foo
protected
	fn mut override foo(bool y): bool
		return not y

class Gaz: public Foo
	property override z: bool
		mut get
			return z
		// get and set stay the same
```
