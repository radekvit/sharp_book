# Literals
Sharp has the following literals:

## Integer literals
Integer literals can be either untyped, or typed.
An untyped integer literal is any sequence of numbers, such as `42`.
A typed integer literal is any sequence of numbers followed by one of the built-in integer types, for example `42u16`.

Additionally, integers can be in base 10 (`42`), base 2 (`0b1001`), base 8 (`042`), or base 16 (`0x54`). This does not collide with the postfix type specification.

Integer literals may contain `'` characters to separate groups of digits (`19'000'000`).

## Floating point literals
Floating point literals are, too, optionally typed.
An untyped float literal is `1.0`.
A typed literal may be a floating point or integer literal followed by one of the built-in floating point type names, e.g. `1.0f32`, or `42f64`.

Floating point literals can be in base 10 (`1e-9`), base 2 (`0b1.001`), or base 16 (`0x5e.fa8E1ef`, exponent is denoted by capital `E` only, digits by lowercase letters only). Base 16 literals cannot be typed, as `f` is a hexa digit.

## Character literals
Character literals signify a single `char`. They are enclosed in single quotes (`'`). For example: `'c'`, `'âš›'`.

### Escaped characters
There are some escape sequences which can signify different characters.

* `\'` single quote
* `\"` double quote
* `\?` question mark
* `\\` backslash
* `\a` audible bell
* `\b` backspace
* `\f` form feed
* `\n` line feed
* `\r` carriage return
* `\t` horizontal tab
* `\v` vertical tab
* `\u{xxxxxx}` or `\U{xxxxxx}` a utf-8 character with up to 6 digits within the parentheses. Syntatically, it must be a valid utf-8 character.

## String literals
String literals are enclosed in double quotes (`"`). They can span multiple lines,
and all tab characters following a newline are not included in the resulting string.
```
fn foo()
	var s = "long string
	with multiple lines"
```

## Custom literals
For any or all of the four literals, we can define a custom literal.
These literals can be of any user defined type. They are created by suffixing any of the literals with `_name`, where *name* is the name of the custom literal.

We will show how to define our custom literals in one of the following chapters.

# Expressions
Expressions are very similar to other programming languages: expressions are evaluated according to the priority and associativity of operators and returns a value. The order of operations is strictly kept, and most expressions (with notable exceptions, for example `x = x++`) are well defined.

Sharp has the following operators, sorted by priority:

| **Priority** | **Operator** | **Operator name** | **Associativity**|
|:------------ |:------------:|:----------------- | ----------------:|
| 1.           | `::`         | scope resolution  | left             |
