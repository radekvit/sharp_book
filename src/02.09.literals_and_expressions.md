# Literals
Sharp has the following literals:

## Integer literals
An integer literal is any sequence of numbers, such as `42`.
Additionally, integers can be in base 10 (`42`), base 2 (`0b1001`), or base 16 (`0x54`).
Integer literals may contain `'` characters to separate groups of digits (`19'000'000`).

Note that this is possible only when the `'` character is in the middle of the integer literal; if put at the very start, it would be interpreted as an invalid character literal.

An integer literal is a special type that is implicitly convertible to any integral type, unless it's too large to fit that type.

## Floating point literals
Floating-point literals are defined as in many other programming languages.
For a detailed reference, see the JSON specification for floating point literals.
A simple example of a float literal would be `1.0`.

Floating point literals can be in base 10 (`1e-9`), base 2 (`0b1.001`), or base 16 (`0x5e.fa8E1ef`, exponent is then denoted by capital `E` only, and digits by lowercase letters only).
Like integral literals, float literals allow separating groups of digits by the use of `'`.

## Character literals
Character literals signify a single `char`. They are enclosed in single quotes (`'`). For example: `'c'`, `'âš›'`.

### Escaped characters
There are some escape sequences which can signify different characters.

* `\'` single quote
* `\"` double quote
* `\?` question mark
* `\\` backslash
* `\a` audible bell
* `\b` backspace
* `\f` form feed
* `\n` line feed
* `\r` carriage return
* `\t` horizontal tab
* `\v` vertical tab
* `\u{xxxxxx}` or `\U{xxxxxx}` a utf-8 character with up to 6 digits within the parentheses. Syntatically, it must be a valid utf-8 character.

## String literals
String literals are enclosed in double quotes (`"`). They can span multiple lines,
and all tab characters following a newline are not included in the resulting string.
```
fn foo()
	var s = "long string
	with multiple lines"
```

## Literal typing
Sharp contains literal typing. We can create literals of different types by adding `_x` to the end of a literal.
`x` is a string corresponding to a type that has a literal conversion defined for that type.

For example, all of the built-in integral and floating-point types have literal conversions defined, so
`5_u8` and `1.845'964_f64` are valid.

The built-in postfixes you can use are `_i8`, `_u8`, `_i16`, `_u16`, `_i32`, `_u32`, `_i64`, `_u64`, `_f16`, `_f32`, `_f64`

User-defined types can have their own literal conversions; they are described in TODO.

# Expressions
Expressions are very similar to other programming languages: expressions are evaluated according to the priority and associativity of operators and returns a value. The order of operations is strictly kept, and most expressions (with notable exceptions, for example `x = x++`) are well defined.

Sharp has the following operators, sorted by priority:

| **Priority** | **Operator** |  **Operator name**  | **Associativity**|
